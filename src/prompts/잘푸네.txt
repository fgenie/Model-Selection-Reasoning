If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
1. Create a variable to keep track of the sum, initialized to 0.
2. Loop through all the natural numbers below 1000.
3. Check if the number is a multiple of 3 or 5.
4. If it is, add the number to the sum variable.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the natural numbers.
6. After the loop ends, return the sum. 

Following the steps above, could you write the code that solves the problem?

def sum_of_multiples():
     sum = 0
     for i in range(1, 1000):
         if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
             sum += i
     return sum

print(sum_of_multiples())
