===================================
1. Declare a variable to keep track of Olivia's money, initialized to 23.
2. Declare another variable to store the cost of each bagel, set to 3.
3. Multiply the cost of each bagel by the number of bagels Olivia bought (5) to get the total cost of bagels.
4. Subtract the total cost of bagels from Olivia's initial money to get the remaining amount.
5. Return the remaining amount of money.

===================================
1. Create a variable `golf_balls` and set it to 58 to represent the initial number of golf balls Michael had.
2. Subtract 23 from `golf_balls` to account for the number of golf balls he lost on Tuesday.
3. Subtract 2 from `golf_balls` again to account for the additional golf balls he lost on Wednesday.
4. The final value of `golf_balls` represents the number of golf balls Michael had at the end of Wednesday.
5. return `golf_balls` to get the result.


===================================
1. Create a variable, `n_computer`, to keep track of the total number of computers, initialized to 9.
2. Create a variable, `n_days`, to represent the number of days installed, initialized to 4.
3. Use a loop to iterate through the days from Monday to Thursday.
4. For each day, add 5 to the total number of computers.
5. Decrement the number of days installed by 1 after each iteration.
6. After the loop ends, print the total number of computers in the server room.
===================================
1. Create a variable called "total_toys" and set it to 5 (initial number of toys Shawn has).
2. Create a variable called "toys_from_mom" and set it to 2 (number of toys Shawn got from his mom).
3. Create a variable called "toys_from_dad" and set it to 2 (number of toys Shawn got from his dad).
4. Add the values of "toys_from_mom" and "toys_from_dad" and store the result in "total_toys".
5. Print the value of "total_toys".
6. [Optional] Add an appropriate message for clarity if desired.
7. [Optional] Add a line break for better readability.
8. [Optional] End the code with a message indicating the completion of the task.

===================================
1. Create a variable called `jason_lollipops` and set it to 20.
2. Create a variable called `denny_lollipops` and set it to unknown (`x`).
3. Subtract `denny_lollipops` from `jason_lollipops` and set it to 12.
4. Write an equation: `jason_lollipops - denny_lollipops = 12`.
5. Solve the equation for `denny_lollipops`.
6. Print the value of `denny_lollipops`.
7. End. 
===================================
1. Create two variables, `leah_chocolates` and `sister_chocolates`, and assign them the initial numbers of chocolates (32 and 42, respectively).
2. Make a variable `total_chocolates` and calculate the sum of `leah_chocolates` and `sister_chocolates`.
3. Subtract the number of chocolates they ate (35) from `total_chocolates` and assign the result to `remaining_chocolates`.
4. Print the value of `remaining_chocolates` to display the total number of chocolates they have left.
5. `<end>`
===================================
1. Create a variable to keep track of the number of cars in the parking lot, initialized to 3.
2. Add 2 to the variable to account for the 2 additional cars that arrived.
3. Return the value of the variable.


===================================
1. Create a variable to keep track of the number of trees planted, initialized to 0.
2. Subtract the initial number of trees in the grove (15) from the final number of trees in the grove (21) to get the number of trees the grove workers planted.
3. Assign this value to the variable created in step 1.
4. Print the value of the variable to display the number of trees planted by the grove workers.
