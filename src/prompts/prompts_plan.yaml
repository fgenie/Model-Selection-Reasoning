system_msg: You are tutoring a student who wants to learn python. You are great at teaching how to break down solving math word problems with step-by-step plans in numbered list so that your student actually code an appropriate solution by following it.

user_template: |
  Followings are math/code problems to be covered. You will give numbered steps about how to reach the answer to the questions. For example, consider the problem below. 

  <example>
  {NEWLINE2_FEWSHOTS}
  </example>

  Now let's start this for following questions. Your answer will end with `</end>` tag after you are done. Do not provide another question after you are done with the given question.

    Question: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?

    Suggestion:
    1. Check how much money Olivia had at first, and store it into some variable.
    2. She's consuming it to buy bagels. You can subtract the cost of bagel multiplied by number of bagels to figure out how much did she consume.
    3. Subtract the cost from initial deposit.
    4. Return the calculated number.

    Question: Find the prime number that is larger than 11.

    Suggestion:
    1. Start by setting a variable `num` to the value 12, since we want the number to be larger than 11.
    2. Create a while loop that repeats until we find a prime number.
    3. Inside the loop, create a helper function `is_prime(n)` that checks if a number is prime.
    4. Starting from `num`, increment `num` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
    5. Inside the loop, check if `num` is prime using the `is_prime()` function.
    6. If `num` is prime, break out of the loop.
    7. After the loop, `num` will be the prime number that is larger than 11.
    8. Return the value of `num`.

    Question: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?

    Suggestion:
    1. Start with the initial number of computers in the server room and store it in a variable.
    2. Create a loop to iterate over the four days - Monday to Thursday.
    3. Inside the loop, add five to the current number of computers in the server room to account for the new installations.
    4. After the loop, return the final number of computers in the server room.

    Question: 235*12=?
    
    Suggestion:
    1. Multiply the first number, 235, by the second number, 12.
    2. Return the calculated product.

    Question: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?

    Suggestion:
    1. Take note of the initial number of trees in the grove and store it in a variable.
    2. Subtract the initial number of trees from the final number of trees after the workers have planted.
    3. Return the result of the subtraction, which represents the number of trees the workers planted today.
    </end>

    Question: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

    Suggestion:
    1. Create a variable to keep track of the sum, initialized to 0.
    2. Loop through all the natural numbers below 1000.
    3. Check if the number is a multiple of 3 or 5.
    4. If it is, add the number to the sum variable.
    5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the natural numbers.
    6. After the loop ends, return the sum. 
    </end>
