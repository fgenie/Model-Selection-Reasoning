You are now solving math word problems. You brilliantly detects the errors in the wrong solution and find `Workaround Method` to correct the solution. The methods you are taking are as follows. Each has its strength and weakness:

- Chain of Thought (cot): Solving problem with writing steps of reasoning in a natural language. Might help correct understanding of the problem but this could be weaker in precise computation.
- Program-aided Language Modeling (pal): Using python language to reason and obtain an accurate answer to the given question, but this could be weaker in understanding the problem. 

Followings are the examples of correcting the wrong solutions with a `Workaround Method` based on diagnosis (`Mistakes`) and `Hint for a better Method choice`.


`Question`: Bella eats 6 apples a day. If during the week she consumes a third of the apples Grace picks, how many apples will Grace have after 6 weeks?
`Method`: Chain-of-Thought (cot)
`Attempt`: To solve this problem, let's break it down:

1. Determine how many apples Bella eats in a week.
2. Calculate a third of the apples that Grace picks based on what Bella eats.
3. Find out how many apples Grace picks in total over 6 weeks.
4. Subtract the apples consumed by Bella from Grace's total to see how many are left.

Step 1: Calculate the apples Bella eats in a week.
Bella eats 6 apples a day, so in one week (7 days), she eats:
6 apples/day * 7 days/week = 42 apples/week

Step 2: Find a third of the apples Grace picks each week.
Since Bella eats a third of the apples picked by Grace, we need to find the total number of apples Grace picks that is three times the amount Bella eats.
1/3 of the apples Grace picks = 42 apples/week (Bella's consumption)
Therefore, the total Grace picks in a week = 42 apples/week * 3 = 126 apples/week

Step 3: Calculate how many apples Grace picks in 6 weeks.
Grace picks 126 apples in one week, so in 6 weeks she picks:
126 apples/week * 6 weeks = 756 apples

Step 4: Subtract the apples consumed by Bella from Grace's total.
Over the course of 6 weeks, Bella eats:
42 apples/week * 6 weeks = 252 apples

Therefore, the total number of apples Grace will have after Bella consumes her third over 6 weeks is:
756 apples - 252 apples = 504 apples

So the answer is, Grace will have 504 apples left after 6 weeks.
`Answer`: 504.0

`Question`: 3 cloves of garlic can repel 2 vampires, 8 vampire bats or 3 wights. How many cloves of garlic are needed to repel 30 vampires, 12 wights and 40 vampire bats?
`Method`: Program-aided Language Modeling (pal)
`Attempt`: 
def solution():
    vampires_ratio = 3 / 2
    wights_ratio = 3 / 3
    vampire_bats_ratio = 3 / 8

    vampires_needed = vampires_ratio * 30
    wights_needed = wights_ratio * 12
    vampire_bats_needed = vampire_bats_ratio * 40

    total_cloves_needed = vampires_needed + wights_needed + vampire_bats_needed
    return total_cloves_needed

result = solution()
print(f"The number of cloves needed: {result}")

`Question`: You can lower the price by 20% if you buy more than fifteen units of iPhone cases. If you pay $500 to buy 18 units, what is the original price?
`Method`: Chain-of-Thought (cot)
`Attempt`: Answer:
First, let's determine the discounted price per unit by dividing the total amount paid by the number of units.

Jason paid $500 for 18 units.
So, the discounted price per unit is $500 / 18 = $27.78 (rounded to two decimal places).

This discounted price represents an 80% of the original price because it is 20% off.
So, $27.78 = 80% of the original price.

To find the original price per unit, we can set up a proportion where the original price (100%) is to the discounted price (80%) as the full original price is to $27.78.
Let's denote the original price as P.

P (100%) / $27.78 (80%) = 1 / 0.8
P = $27.78 / 0.8
P = $34.725 (rounded to three decimal places)

Therefore, the original price per unit of iPhone case before the discount is approximately $34.725.
`Answer`: 34.725
`Evaluation`: Wrong (correct answer: 625.0)
`Mistakes`: The calculations were correct in determining the original price per unit after the discount. However, the error occurred in not recognizing that the question was asking for the original total price of 18 units, not the price per unit.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: Using program-aided language model would help in accurately performing the calculations without misunderstanding the question's requirement (whether it is asking for the price per unit or the total price).
`Workaround Method`: Program-aided Language Modeling (pal)
`Corrected Attempt`: 
def solution():
    units_purchased = 18  # units of iPhone cases bought
    discount_price_paid = 500  # total price paid after discount
    discount_rate = 0.20  # 20% discount
    percentage_paid = 1 - discount_rate  # 80% of the original price paid

    original_price_total = discount_price_paid / percentage_paid  # total original price for 18 units
    original_price_per_unit = original_price_total / units_purchased  # original price per unit

    # If the question is asking for the total original price for 18 units
    result = original_price_total

    # If the question is asking for the original price per unit
    #result = original_price_per_unit

    return result

`Question`: You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50. How much does 1 apple cost if your total bill was $66?
`Method`: Program-aided Language Modeling (pal)
`Attempt`: 
def solution():
    total_fruits = 36
    fruits_per_type = total_fruits // 3  # because they are evenly split
    orange_price = 0.5
    total_bill = 66

    # Calculate the total cost of all the oranges
    oranges_cost = fruits_per_type * orange_price

    # Subtract the cost of the oranges from the total bill
    apples_and_watermelons_cost = total_bill - oranges_cost

    # Since the apples and watermelons are evenly split in the total cost,
    # we divide by the number of each fruit type to find the cost of one watermelon (or the equivalent of 4 apples)
    watermelon_cost = apples_and_watermelons_cost / (fruits_per_type * 2)  # there are 12 apples and 12 watermelons in total

    # The cost of one apple is a fourth of the cost of one watermelon
    apple_cost = watermelon_cost / 4

    return apple_cost

# call the function to get the result
print(solution())

`Answer`: 0.625
`Evaluation`: Wrong (correct answer: 1.0)
`Mistakes`: The error in the attempt lies in the incorrect calculation and interpretation of apples and watermelons cost. It wrongly assumes that the cost of apples and watermelons is split evenly between each individual fruit which is not stated in the problem.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: A Chain-of-Thought would guide through a logical step-by-step approach, ensuring correct interpretation of relationships between the costs of fruits and accurately distributing the total bill among different fruit types.
`Workaround Method`: Chain-of-Thought (cot)
`Corrected Attempt`: Let's break down the problem into several steps:

1. There are 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons. So to find out how many of each fruit there are, we divide the total number of fruits by the number of different fruits:

36 fruits / 3 types of fruits = 12 fruits of each type

This means there are 12 oranges, 12 apples, and 12 watermelons.

2. The cost of 1 orange is $0.50. So the total cost for all the oranges is:

12 oranges * $0.50/orange = $6

3. We have a total bill of $66 for all the fruits. The cost for the oranges is $6, so the remaining amount is for the apples and watermelons:

Total bill - Cost of oranges = Remaining amount for apples and watermelons
$66 - $6 = $60

This $60 is the combined cost of apples and watermelons.

4. Now, we know that 4 apples cost the same as 1 watermelon. This means that the 12 apples are equivalent in cost to:

12 apples / 4 apples per watermelon = 3 watermelons

So the cost of 12 apples is the same as the cost for 3 watermelons.

5. Because there are an equal number of apples and watermelons (12 each), and their combined total cost is $60, we can split this cost equally between the apples and the watermelons:

$60 / 2 = $30 for apples and $30 for watermelons

As we found earlier, 12 apples are the cost equivalent of 3 watermelons, therefore the cost for 12 apples is $30. To find the cost per apple, we divide the cost for apples by the number of apples:

$30 / 12 apples = $2.50 per apple

So the cost of 1 apple is $2.50.
