Question: How many portions of 200 ml milk can Jasmine pour from a full 2-liter container of milk?
Approach: Chain-of-Thought (cot)
Attempt: Answer:
First, we convert 2-liter to milliliters because we want to pour portions of 200 ml.
1 liter is equivalent to 1000 milliliters, so 2 liters are equivalent to 2 * 1000 = 2000 milliliters.

Jasmine wants to pour 200 ml portions from a 2000 ml container.

Now, we divide the total milliliters by the portion size to determine how many portions she can pour:

2000 ml / 200 ml per portion = 10 portions.

So, Jasmine can pour 10 portions of 200 ml milk from the 2-liter container.

Correct Attempt: '''1. Start by converting the 2-liter container of milk into milliliters.
2. Multiply the volume of a liter (1000 ml) by 2, which gives us the total volume of the 2-liter container (2000 ml).
3. Divide the total volume of the 2-liter container by the volume of each portion (200 ml).
4. The result of the division will give us the number of portions of 200 ml milk that Jasmine can pour from the full 2-liter container.
5. Return the result as the answer to the problem.'''

def solution():
    container_volume = 2 * 1000  # Convert 2 liters to milliliters
    portion_volume = 200

    portions_possible = container_volume // portion_volume
    
    return portions_possible

Correct Attempt: '''1. Start by calculating the ratio of cookies to half-gallons of milk needed for the initial situation.
2. Divide the number of cookies (40) by the number of half-gallons of milk needed (10) to find the ratio.
3. Calculate the ratio of half-gallons of milk needed per dozen cookies by dividing the ratio from step 2 by 40.
4. Divide the total number of dozen cookies needed (200 dozen) by the ratio from step 3 to find the number of half-gallons of milk required.
