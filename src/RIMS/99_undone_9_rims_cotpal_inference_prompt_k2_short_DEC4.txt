You are now solving math word problems. You brilliantly detects the errors in the wrong solution and find `Workaround Method` to correct the solution. The methods you are taking are as follows. Each has its strength and weakness:

- Chain of Thought (cot): Solving problem with writing steps of reasoning in a natural language. Might help correct understanding of the problem but this could be weaker in precise computation.
- Program-aided Language Model (pal): Using python language to reason and obtain an accurate answer to the given question, but this could be weaker in understanding the problem. 

Followings are the examples of correcting the wrong solutions with a `Workaround Method` based on diagnosis (`Mistakes`) and `Hint for a better Method choice`.


`Question`: Bella eats 6 apples a day. If during the week she consumes a third of the apples Grace picks, how many apples will Grace have after 6 weeks?
`Method`: Program-aided Language Modeling (pal)
`Attempt`: 
def solution():
    apples_bella_eats_per_day = 6
    days_per_week = 7
    weeks = 6
    
    # Calculate how many apples Bella consumes in one week
    apples_bella_consumes_weekly = apples_bella_eats_per_day * days_per_week
    
    # Assuming this is a third of what Grace picks, let's find the total Grace picks weekly
    apples_grace_picks_weekly = apples_bella_consumes_weekly * 3
    
    # Now calculate how many apples Grace will have after 6 weeks
    apples_grace_has_after_six_weeks = apples_grace_picks_weekly * weeks
    
    return apples_grace_has_after_six_weeks

# Let's call the function and print the result to get the answer
print(solution())

`Answer`: 756.0
`Evaluation`: Wrong (correct answer: 504.0)
`Mistakes`: The attempt explicitly presumes that the question asks for the total number of apples Grace picks in 6 weeks, without considering the subtraction of the apples Bella consumes.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: Using chain of thought could guide through logical steps needed to correct the initial misunderstanding: calculating the apples Bella eats, the total Grace picks, and then the remainder Grace keeps.
`Workaround Method`: Chain-of-Thought (cot)
`Corrected Attempt`: To solve this problem, let's break it down:

1. Determine how many apples Bella eats in a week.
2. Calculate a third of the apples that Grace picks based on what Bella eats.
3. Find out how many apples Grace picks in total over 6 weeks.
4. Subtract the apples consumed by Bella from Grace's total to see how many are left.

Step 1: Calculate the apples Bella eats in a week.
Bella eats 6 apples a day, so in one week (7 days), she eats:
6 apples/day * 7 days/week = 42 apples/week

Step 2: Find a third of the apples Grace picks each week.
Since Bella eats a third of the apples picked by Grace, we need to find the total number of apples Grace picks that is three times the amount Bella eats.
1/3 of the apples Grace picks = 42 apples/week (Bella's consumption)
Therefore, the total Grace picks in a week = 42 apples/week * 3 = 126 apples/week

Step 3: Calculate how many apples Grace picks in 6 weeks.
Grace picks 126 apples in one week, so in 6 weeks she picks:
126 apples/week * 6 weeks = 756 apples

Step 4: Subtract the apples consumed by Bella from Grace's total.
Over the course of 6 weeks, Bella eats:
42 apples/week * 6 weeks = 252 apples

Therefore, the total number of apples Grace will have after Bella consumes her third over 6 weeks is:
756 apples - 252 apples = 504 apples

So the answer is, Grace will have 504 apples left after 6 weeks.

`Question`: Mark deposited $88 in a bank. Bryan deposited $40 less than five times as much as Mark. How much did Mark deposit in the bank?
`Method`: Chain-of-Thought (cot)
`Attempt`: Answer:
Mark deposited $88 in the bank.

Bryan deposited an amount that is $40 less than five times what Mark deposited. To find out how much this is, let's first calculate five times the amount Mark deposited:

5 times $88 is 5 * $88 = $440.

Now, Bryan deposited $40 less than this amount, which is $440 - $40. However, the question is asking for how much Mark deposited, not Bryan.

Since we know Mark deposited $88, and the question is only about Mark's deposit, the answer is:

Mark deposited $88 in the bank.
`Answer`: 88.0
`Evaluation`: Wrong (correct answer: 400.0)
`Mistakes`: The mistake in the attempt is that the final computation for Bryan's deposit was correct but not relevant to the question. Additionally, the answer was incorrectly reported as the amount Mark deposited when the calculation actually derived Bryan's deposit, despite the question explicitly asking for Mark's deposit, which was already provided in the prompt.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: Utilize Program-aided Language Model to avoid confusion between the amounts deposited by Mark and Bryan, and to ensure that only the requested amount is reported. 
`Workaround Method`: Program-aided Language Modeling (pal)
`Corrected Attempt`: 
def solution():
    mark_deposit = 88
    bryan_deposit = (5 * mark_deposit) - 40
    return bryan_deposit

# To get the result:
result = solution()

`Answer`: 400.0
`Evaluation`: Correct


Now, try the `Question` below following the same procedure as above. Try the question with the choice of your `Method`, and evaluate the `Answer`. If your `Attempt` is considered wrong, identify the `Mistakes` and reason to take `Workaround Method` by writing `Hint for a better Method choice`. Based on it, reattempt correctly on `Corrected Attempt`.
