===================================
1. Start by defining a variable to store Olivia's initial amount of money, let's call it "money_initial" and store 23 as a initial value.
2. Define another variable to store the cost of each bagel, let's call it "bagel_cost" initialized with 3.
3. Define another variable to keep track of the number of bagels Olivia bought, let's call it "num_bagels", and assign a value, 5.
4. Calculate the total amount of money spent on bagels by multiplying "bagel_cost" and "num_bagels".
5. Subtract the total amount spent on bagels from Olivia's initial amount of money to find out how much money she has left.
6. Return the result of the subtraction.
===================================
1. Start by defining a variable to represent the initial number of golf balls Michael had (e.g., `golf_balls_initial = 58`).
2. Subtract the number of balls lost on Tuesday from the initial number of balls (e.g., `remaining_balls = initial_balls - 23`).
3. Subtract the number of balls lost on Wednesday from the number of remaining balls (e.g., `final_balls = remaining_balls - 2`).
4. Return the `final_balls` which represents the number of golf balls Michael had at the end of Wednesday.
===================================
1. Start by setting a variable count_computers to represent the current number of computers in the server room.
2. Initialize count_computers to 9, as mentioned in the question.
3. Create a loop to iterate over the days from Monday to Thursday.
4. Inside the loop, increase count_computers by 5 each day.
5. After the loop finishes, the value of count_computers will represent the total number of computers in the server room. Return the final result.
===================================
1. Start by storing the initial number of toys Shawn has as a variable, let's say `initial_toys`.
2. Initialize `initial_toys` to 5, since Shawn initially has 5 toys.
3. Create two variables, `toys_from_mom` and `toys_from_dad`, to represent the number of toys Shawn received from his mom and dad respectively.
4. Assign 2 to both `toys_from_mom` and `toys_from_dad`, since Shawn got 2 toys from each parent.
5. Create a new variable `total_toys` and assign it the sum of `initial_toys`, `toys_from_mom`, and `toys_from_dad`.
6. Print the value of `total_toys`.
7. Verify the output to see if it matches the expected result.
===================================
1. Determine the unknown quantity in the problem: We need to find out how many lollipops Jason gave to Denny.
2. Let's represent the unknown quantity with a variable, like "x".
4. Set up an equation based on the information given in the problem: Jason's initial number of lollipops minus the number of lollipops he gave to Denny should equal his current number of lollipops.
5. Translate the equation into mathematical symbols: 20 - x = 12.
6. Solve the equation to find the value of "x": Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation, resulting in 20 - x - 12 = 0. Simplify further to obtain x = 8.
7. Therefore, Jason gave 8 lollipops to Denny.
===================================
1. Start by defining the initial number of chocolates Leah and her sister have.
2. Assign Leah's initial number of chocolates to a variable.
3. Assign her sisters's initial number of chocolates to a variable.
4. Calculate the total number of chocolates they have together.
5. Subtract the number of chocolates they ate from the total.
6. Display the total number of chocolates they have left.
===================================
1. Start by initializing a variable `num_cars` with the initial number of cars in the parking lot.
2. Assign the value of 3 to `num_cars` since there are initially 3 cars in the parking lot.
3. Initialize another variable `new_cars` with the number of cars that arrive.
4. Assign the value of 2 to `new_cars` since 2 more cars arrive.
5. Add the value of `new_cars` to `num_cars` to get the total number of cars in the parking lot.
6. Print the value of `num_cars` to display the result.
===================================
1. Define the total number of trees in the grove before planting as a variable, let's say "initial_trees". Set "initial_trees" equal to 15.
2. Define the total number of trees in the grove after planting as another variable, let's say "final_trees". Set "final_trees" equal to 21.
3. Calculate the number of trees planted today by subtracting "initial_trees" from "final_trees".
4. Store the result in a variable, let's say "trees_planted_today".
5. Print the value of "trees_planted_today" to display the answer.
