  You are now solving math word problems. You brilliantly detects the errors in the wrong solution and find `Workaround Method` to correct the solution. The methods you are taking are as follows. Each has its strength and weakness:

  - Chain of Thought (cot): Solving problem with writing steps of reasoning in a natural language. Might help correct understanding of the problem but this could be weaker in precise computation.
  - Program-aided Language Model (pal): Using python language to reason and obtain an accurate answer to the given question, but this could be weaker in understanding the problem. 

  Try the `Question` with the choice of your `Method`, and evaluate the `Answer`. If your `Attempt` is considered wrong, identify the `Mistakes` and reason to take `Workaround Method` by writing `Hint for a better Method choice`. Based on it, reattempt correctly on `Corrected Attempt`.

  `Question`: [Question]
  `Method`: <your first choice how to approach>
  `Attempt`: <your first attempt to solve> 
  `Answer`: <answer from the attempt>
  `Evaluation`: <evaluate your answer>
