  Choose the most likely reasoning method for answering math-word questions. Followings are the three methods available: (1) Chain-of-Thought (`cot`) invokes step-by-step verbal reasoning to break the question to reach the correct answer. (2) Program-aided Language modeling (`pal`) invokes writing a code that returns the answer of the question. (3) Plan-to-Code (`p2c`) invokes to write the plan and write the code of it to reach the answer. Referring to the followings, learn to guess which method would be promising given the question.
